# Bootstrap Portfolio
In this challenge, I have attempted to make a portfolio using basic Bootstrap framework elements with the help of this website: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/

## Installation
I first created a repository on Github, copied the SSH key and then cloned it to my local machine.

An example of the challenge where it has a comment workflow to organise changes.

##Credits
I used this existing template's footer section to create my footer section with changes to it.
