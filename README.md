# Bootstrap Portfolio
In this challenge, I have attempted to make a portfolio using basic Bootstrap framework elements with the help of this website: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/.
I've also added various features such as cards, rounded avatar styling, colors.

## Installation
I first created a repository on Github, copied the SSH key and then cloned it to my local machine.
